# Course-work-C++
My coursework I've been doing on a udemy course. Keeping it private as it's a paid course and unsure if I'm allowed to share publicly. I wanted too upload it so peers can review my progress as I'm new to coding. 
04/04/2023 update - I've made a mess of this folder. going to sort through and attempt to clean.

UPDATE 05/05/2023 
All useless files have been removed and what's left is just my code.
I've also decided that I need to change what I'm uploaded - I have been documenting things that I do as I learn it but this is taking up space and becoming messy - Going forward I will only upload code used for certain parts of certain projects and keep all the learning in a seperate word pad which I will upload at the end. This way it will be a lot more clear what the project is and what I'm doing.

UPDATE 07/05/2023 - I have one last project for this particular course. I'm going to create this in a new repositary to avoid this because over crowded.
