# Course-work-C++

My coursework I've been doing on a udemy course. I wanted to upload it so peers can review my progress as I'm new to coding. 

## Project Overview

This course consists of 4 projects.

1. Project 1 - First concepts - setting up VS code - Printing a "hello world" to the terminal.
2. Project 2 - Axe Game - Create a game where the circle needs to avoid the square or the "axe"
3. Project 3 - Dasher game - Create a runner game with an animated 2D character which runs and jumps over obstacles with a win and loss condition. 
4. Project 4 - Clash game - Create a top down game where you can run around in a world with enemies that can chase and do damage to you. You can attack and kill the enemies and create an "open world"


## What is the course?

This course is created by the gamedev.tv team on udemy. It's called "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners"
